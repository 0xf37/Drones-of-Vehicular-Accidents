To detect a simple accident using an MPU6050 accelerometer and gyroscope sensor, you would need to measure the acceleration and angular velocity on the x, y, and z axes.

The accelerometer measures acceleration in g-forces (g), where 1 g is the acceleration due to Earth's gravity. The MPU6050 accelerometer can measure a range of +/- 2g, +/- 4g, +/- 8g, or +/- 16g. In the event of an accident, the accelerometer would detect a sudden increase in acceleration on one or more axes.

The gyroscope measures angular velocity in degrees per second (째/s). The MPU6050 gyroscope can measure a range of +/- 250째/s, +/- 500째/s, or +/- 1000째/s. In the event of an accident, the gyroscope would detect a sudden increase in angular velocity on one or more axes.

To detect an accident, you would need to write an algorithm to monitor the sensor data in real-time, and look for specific patterns of acceleration and angular velocity that indicate a collision has occurred.

To detect an accident you can use different techniques such as:

    Compare the data from the accelerometer and gyroscope to a threshold value that indicate an accident, if the value exceed the threshold you can consider it as an accident.
    Using machine learning techniques such as neural networks to detect an accident based on the data from the sensor
    Combining the data from multiple sensors to detect an accident with more accuracy

It is worth noting that, the values of x, y, and z in accelerometer and gyroscope is not fixed, it will change based on the direction of the accident, the type of accident and the sensitivity of the sensor.
